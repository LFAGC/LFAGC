### [ðŸ“Ž](https://ingesprekmet24.nl) In Gesprek Met

In this project, a friend and I developed a website for a live event at our school. This application allowed users to vote on specific questions that were asked during the event. If you're a host on the website you're able to lead the event live and assign questions to the users during that event.
